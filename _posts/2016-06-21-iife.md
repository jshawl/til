title: Alternate IIFE Syntax
---

Today I learned an alternate way of writing immediately invoked
function expressions

## Before

```js
(function(){
  console.log("err")
})()
```
## After

```js
!function(){
  console.log("err")
}()
```

This works because  `!function(){}` is an expression, as is `(function(){})`
