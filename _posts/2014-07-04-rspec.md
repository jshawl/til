Today I learned how to implement tests for my ruby applications (not rails) with rspec.

I've been working on a command-line app idea to simplify the process of cloning repo's via GitHub.

<https://github.com/jshawl/g>

Since I'll need to handle different URL values:

- "git@github.com:jshawl/dotfiles"
- "jshawl/dotfiles"
- "dotfiles"

When running `g clone <repo>`, I thought this would be a great example for doing
test-driven development with rspec.

I've only got a test or two [here](https://github.com/jshawl/g/blob/master/spec/g_spec.rb):

##g_spec.rb

```ruby
require_relative "./spec_helper"
require_relative "../g"

describe G do
 it "has a url" do
  g = G.new "git@github.com:jshawl/dotfiles"
  expect(g.url).not_to eq("")
 end
 it "clones persanal repos" do
  g = G.new "dotfiles"
  expect(g.url).to eq("git@github.com:jshawl/dotfiles")
 end
end
```

but the tests are passing and I think this will be a great way to make sure `g` doesn't interfere
with the good old `git` commands.

Next step: enable colors in the terminal output.
